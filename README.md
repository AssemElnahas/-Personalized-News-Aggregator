1. **Error: `401 - Your API key is invalid or incorrect.`**
   - Ensure that your NewsAPI key is valid and correctly entered in the code.
   - You can test the key with a simple request:
     ```python
     import requests

     API_KEY = 'your_actual_api_key'
     BASE_URL = 'https://newsapi.org/v2/everything'
     response = requests.get(BASE_URL, params={'q': 'AI', 'apiKey': API_KEY})
     print(response.json())
     ```

2. **No Content to Summarize:**
   - Some articles may not have enough content for summarization. These will be skipped.
